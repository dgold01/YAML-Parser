title: The day before surgery
text: |
  Tomorrow is the day of your surgery. Give yourself plenty of time to travel to the
  hospital and make sure you have everything you need with you - you will find a
  checklist here in the app with suggestions on what to bring.<br>

  In general:<br>
  - Remember to follow the fasting instructions from your team. Having an empty
  stomach reduces the risk of vomiting while under sedation or general anaesthetic,
  which can cause severe complications if vomit passes into the lungs<br>
  - Follow any pre-surgery washing instructions, or if not provided, shower normally
    including washing your hair<br>
  - Do you have everything you need?<br>
  - Double-check where and when to arrive and how you will get there<br>
  - Drink plenty of fluids today so you are well hydrated for surgery<br>


    Picture yourself fully recovered and try to get a good night's sleep.<br>
