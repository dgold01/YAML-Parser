title: The day before surgery
text: |
  Tomorrow is the day of your surgery. Give yourself plenty of time to travel to the
  hospital and make sure you have everything you need with you - you will find a
  checklist here in the app with suggestions on what to bring.
In general:
- Remember to follow the fasting instructions from your team. Having an empty
- stomach reduces the risk of vomiting while under sedation or general anaesthetic,
  which can cause severe complications if vomit passes into the lungs
- Follow any pre-surgery washing instructions, or if not provided, shower normally
  including washing your hair
- Do you have everything you need?
- Double-check where and when to arrive and how you will get there
- Drink plenty of fluids today so you are well hydrated for surgery
  Picture yourself fully recovered and try to get a good night’s sleep.
