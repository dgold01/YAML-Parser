  # Hello 
  
  There are several steps that you can take at home in the days and weeks before your
  operation to help ensure a smooth and pleasant return from hospital.
  Preparing your mind, body and home for your recovery are just a few key steps to
  help you get ready for your upcoming surgery.
  The information, notifications and checklists here in the app will help guide your
  preparations - such as stocking up on food, removing trip hazards, putting things
  within easy reach and generally planning ahead for the first days and weeks with your
  new hip.
  **If you are feeling unwell, or if there is any reason you think you might not be
  able to go ahead with the operation, please get in touch with your clinical team as
  soon as you can.**
